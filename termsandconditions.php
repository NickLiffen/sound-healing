<p>I take full responsibility for any clearing I may go through with regard to sound healing, 

crystal healing, any intuitive guidance I receive and any issues which may come up as a result 

of these services.  I understand it is necessary and normal for blocked energy to be released 

after a treatment, to enable energy to flow freely again, promoting fitness, health and 

wellbeing.</p>
