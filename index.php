<div id = "abouttextBox">
<p class='textNextToPicture'>From as long as I can remember, I have been on a journey through life and it's 

most mystical and spiritual aspects. As a child, I used to collect crystals on my 

many holidays to Cornwall which, later on in life led me to study Crystal Healing 

for two years. This took me on an amazing journey, opening me up fully to the 

world of energy and vibrational medicine.  Here I also learned about colour 

therapy, flower essences and sacred geometry.

 

An opportunity arose for me to attend a Teacher Training course, which led me 

to teach as a part-time Adult Education Lecturer in Crystal Healing for six years 

at Basingstoke College of Technology. 

Having practised Hatha Yoga, I then discovered Kundalini Yoga, which took me 

on a long journey of empowerment, releasing, letting go, embracing the Divine 

energy within and was truly life changing.

 

Over the years I have also spent time with others involved in earth healing 

ceremonies at various sacred sites in the UK such as Stonehenge, Avebury and 

Glastonbury. This leads me to where I am today having been guided to train in 

Sound Healing with Atlantis College of Crystal Healing in Somerset.  Here the 

amazing journey I have been on, unfolded further, with so many synchronicites.  

This fills me with excitement as to where this journey will take me next …

Some Qualifications include: Sound Healing Diploma (Atlantis College of Crystal 

Healing), Crystal Healing Diploma (Lucis College), Further Education and Adult 

Education Teacher’s Certificate (City and Guide). Please contact me about the other 

qualifications I hold.</p>

   <div class="column-center">"Before attending Cheryl's sound bath, I had overwhelming anxiety which

crippled me severely. Cheryl has a natural gift for her sound and took me on a 

journey which allowed me to leave my anxiety in the energetic space.  I have 

since been free from anxiety and fear; I couldn't recommend her treatment 

enough!  - Ben</div>
   <div class="column-left">I attended the Winter Solstice Sound Bath with excitement, as I know how

powerful sound is. I had a stiff lower back when I arrived and it was seizing up as 

time went on.  After the hour session I got up and was so happy, as my stiff back 

had completely gone. The sound had released the blockage; amazing!  I would 

highly recommend it to anyone, as Cheryl is very gifted with her voice and 

instruments -</div>
   <div class="column-right">This was my first ever-sound bath and I found it to have

me. I liked the way Cheryl met each attendee personally and created a warm, 

relaxed atmosphere. Once the treatment began, almost straight away I could feel 

the vibrations of the sounds travelling along my body.  I felt a release in my 

stomach and a great deal of emotion and the sense of letting go. I am a tinnitus 

sufferer and actually felt that after the treatment the tinnitus had got quieter.  I 

really felt the benefits of this wonderful therapy and look forward to enjoying it 

again in the future - Gillian</div>
